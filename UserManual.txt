Good Evening and Welcome to the Simple Compiler!
The goal of this project is to take a Simple program that you have written and run it! Exciting, I know!
To achive this goal, it'll be like a stalking an ex which is to say it'll be a group project.

 g++ SLang.cpp SLang.h main.cpp -std=c++11 -o main
